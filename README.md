# Crop-Recommendation

This project aims to recommend the best crop(s) to grow in a particular farm based on the soil properties and weather conditions of the area. The system uses k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm to predict the crop(s) that are most likely to thrive in a given location.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) , potassium (K), temperature, humidity, ph, rainfall along with the crops that were grown in those locations. 

# Algorithm
The kNN algorithm was chosen for this project because it is a simple and effective classification algorithm that works well with small to medium sized datasets. The algorithm is implemented using scikit-learn library in Python.

# Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test set, which indicates that it can make reliable crop recommendations based on the input parameters.
